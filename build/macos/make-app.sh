# Signing is deliberately separate from distribution. Without a Developer ID certificate this
# produces an ad-hoc signed bundle, which runs on the machine that built it but is rejected by
# Gatekeeper anywhere else. Set EASYCHAT_SIGN_IDENTITY to sign for distribution; notarisation needs
# an Apple account and is a further step, documented in macOS.md rather than automated here.

# Single file, but without self-extracting the native libraries.
#
# This is what makes the bundle signable. codesign treats every file beside the main executable as
# nested code, so an ordinary publish — which leaves deps.json, runtimeconfig.json and a few hundred
# managed assemblies there — cannot be signed at all: the JSON files are not code and cannot carry a
# signature. Single file folds the runtime, the assemblies and both JSON files into the executable,
# leaving only Mach-O libraries beside it.
#
# The native libraries are deliberately *not* self-extracted. Extracted copies land outside the
# bundle and carry no signature, which the hardened runtime then refuses to load unless library
# validation is disabled. Keeping them as real files means they are signed with everything else.
